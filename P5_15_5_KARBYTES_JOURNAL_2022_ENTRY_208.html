<p>Earlier today while perusing a Reddit forum about homelessness, I read a piece of advice that, if one is a vagrant, one should assume that only what that vagrant carries on its person belongs to that vagrant. While I do have some personal belongings stowed away in &#8220;my&#8221; room at my dad&#8217;s house (namely two backup laptops, one backup backpack, and various sentimental objects) and in my mom&#8217;s car (namely an extra backpack, a tent, steel-toed work shoes, and some tacky interview clothes) which I left parked in my mom&#8217;s driveway with the intent to never drive it again, I would say that, practically speaking, I have all of my personal belongings in the backpack I wear daily (namely my birth certificate, my laptop computer and charger, my phone and charger, clothing, sleeping bag, dental hygiene supplies, and other accessories).</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, I am back in Dublin/Pleasanton at approximately 10PM. The sky is clear with a 70% full moon and stars. The air temperature feels like it is approximately 60 degrees Fahrenheit and there is a slight breeze. I decided to default to camping in Dublin/Pleasanton instead of Castro Valley most nights for the next few weeks (at least until I settle into a stable job routine and have the means to get to work efficiently and on time). One of the first items I intend to purchase with my paycheck is a bicyle. That would help me be able to commute between Castro Valley (Dublin/Pleasanton, et cetera) and wherever I work immensely. I like not having to worry about purchasing gasoline, worrying about a car having issues which require the car be taken into a shop for expensive and time consuming repairs, and other inconveniences which come from driving a car and being responsible for its upkeep. A bicycle is order of magnitude cheaper and is lower maintenance and emits zero pollution.</p>
